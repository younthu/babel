      You must write here the minimal imput code necessary to reproduce the bug.
      Even better, you can share a link to the Babel [REPL](https://babel.dev/repl):
      this will make it easier for us to reproduce the issue, and it may help fixing
      the bug sooner.
      If it's not possible to reproduce the bug with a single file, a GitHub Repository
      is also ok.
